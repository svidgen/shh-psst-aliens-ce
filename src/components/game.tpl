Hi there hero! (⛄)

Talk to people (🙍) by pressing `T`, and they'll tell
you how many aliens (👽) they've seen.

Don't talk to anyone you suspect is an alien, or
they will WOUND you. (🩸). <b>Three wounds and you lose.</b>

Press `K` to kill anyone you suspect is an alien.
Don't kill regular people (⚰️)
or their friends will get mad. (😠)

<i>(And Angry people don't share information!!!)</i>

<b>If you you kill 3 regular people, you lose.</b>

Navigate with WASD or your arrow keys.
