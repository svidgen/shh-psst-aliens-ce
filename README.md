how many aliens (👽) they've seen.

Don't talk to anyone you suspect is an alien,
or they will WOUND you. (🩸).
<b>Three wounds and you lose.</b>

Kill anyone you suspect is an alien.
Don't kill regular people (⚰️)
... or their friends will get mad. (😠)

<i>(Angry people don't talk!!!)</i>

<b>If you you kill 3 regular people, you lose.</b>

Navigate with WASD, your arrow keys,
or the <i>on-screen Arrow buttons</i>.
